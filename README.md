# drier
Filament drier concept for my bachelors thesis.
This CAD model has a basic outline of how I designed my filament drier with aluminium extrusions and Aluminium composite panels. 
Sides are meant to be attached via T-nuts and screws. Top lid is not implemented, so I just did the same as with sides
